            <p> With the steady, vicious rise of Communism and the radical left,
                conservatives could no longer enjoy their rights of democracy and freedom of speech,
                our once rightfully great people at the mercy of the liberal dictatorship. This
                was the dark ages. After the decades of torment,
                the need for the Conservative State was clear. But yet, in the time of our greatest crisis,
                we prevailed. Veteran conservatives brought the armarments from America, while staunch
                conservatives from Great Britain came ready to kick some liberal ass. A steady stream of
                conservative conservatives also flowed in from Australia. After process of elimination,
                we sadly had to abandon our original settlement plans for the entireity of Saudi Arabia for
                logistical reasons, and instead settled on a completely undoubtably uninhabited island
                just 556 Kilometers south of Sri Lanka. Conservatoria was henceforth created by the
                great <strong>Founding Men</strong> of on the 4th of June, 2026. This marked the first
                annual <em>Founding-Day</em>, the second-most important Conservatorian holiday after
                <em>Freedom-Day</em> on September 10th, which commemorates our first peacekeeping
                mission to Sri Lanka, and the start of Conservatoria's freedom exportation
                trade. Now, Conservatoria stands as the ultimate safe haven for conservatives,
                our "motherland", if you will. This is most commonly reffered to as a "conservatorium",
                the term used to describe the conservative state. This is <em>not</em> to be confused
                with secondary defenition of conservatorium, usually referring to musical education,
                which completely goes against our citizens' beliefs and family
                values.

            <h2 class="MainPageSubHeading2">Our Society</h2>
            <p>Conservatorian way of life rests on four core constitutional values: Liberty,
                Democracy, Patriotism, and of course, Family. Although unbridled patriotism,
                liberty, and democracy are key, nation-building values for Conservatoria, the vitality of
                family and accompanying family values can not be understated. To build such a great and productive
                country like ours, we need everyone to be a hard working, model citizen. This is why every
                good Conservatorian citizen is a superior, y-chromosomed heteronormative member of the Conservative
                State.
                Those unable to meet these conditions are selected for our infallable re-education military training
                programme, to eventually bring them back up to their brilliant, model citizen selves if possible!
